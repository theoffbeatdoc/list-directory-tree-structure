# list-directory-tree-structure
 List directory tree structure in Python: to list all sub-directories or all files in a directory as a tree

## Idea/Aim
I have a lot of medical lecture video series downloaded on my PC and often I face a hard time in finding the exact video on a topic by navigating through the complex directories and subdirectories structure. Also I wanted to have an index of all the various video files in those folders. That's how I ran upon the idea of developing this simple tool :)

## The Code
The main code is based on an answer I found in a stackoverflow thread. :wink:
>> https://stackoverflow.com/a/59109706

Then I added an UI component just so that I don't need to run the code and pass parameters manually each time I wanna use the tool.
Also, I created an executable outta the simple python code for anybody to use! 	:sunglasses:
